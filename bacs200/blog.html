    <h2>About Immigration Reform</h2>
      <p>
        "Immigration reform is not just something that has started as a conversation over the past few years, but has been a topic of debate for our society and political leaders since the start of this country. The <a href="https://cis.org/Historical-Overview-Immigration-Policy">history of immigration</a>can date back to 1876, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared immigration a federal responsibility.
        Today, there is a large debate in our country as to whether or not our immigration policy should be opened to more individuals or less, and also a debate as to what should be done with individuals who have entered the country illegaly in the past and are now seeking citizenship. This is a complicated issue as the decisions that are made can have a major impact on not just those seeking to immigrate to this country but also the country as a whole.  Both parties have taken a different approach to immigration reform and would like to discuss what both of those stances are and what implications could come from a social, economical and political stand point."
