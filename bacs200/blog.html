    <h2>About Immigration Reform</h2>
      <p>
        Immigration reform is not just something that has started as a conversation over the past few years, but has been a topic of debate for our society and political leaders since the start of this country. The <a href="https://cis.org/Historical-Overview-Immigration-Policy">history of immigration</a>can date back to 1876, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared immigration a federal responsibility.
        Today, there is a large debate in our country as to whether or not our immigration policy should be opened to more individuals or less, and also a debate as to what should be done with individuals who have entered the country illegaly in the past and are now seeking citizenship. This is a complicated issue as the decisions that are made can have a major impact on not just those seeking to immigrate to this country but also the country as a whole.  Both parties have taken a different approach to immigration reform and would like to discuss what both of those stances are and what implications could come from a social, economical and political stand point.
    </p>
    <h2>Social Implications</h2>
      <p> 
        In a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12159550/">Pubmed.gov article</a> It discusses the issues of immigrants and migrants who come here from other countries. One of the biggest social problems for immigrants usually comes with the stress of moving to a new country where they may or may not know English at a proficient level. This can cause issues with getting a job along with numerous other aspects to adapting to the culural changes.
        This problem has been shown to be fixed with more education for incoming immigrants to make sure they can become properley assimilated into America's lifestyle change.  One issue that arises with this is if the U.S. should provide this type of education for illegal immigrants and provide resources for them. One solution to this would be limiting the amount of illegal immigrants in this country by either enacting stronger borders or making it easier for those to become citizens so they can remove the status of illegal from them.
        Depending on which side of the politicla spectrum you stand on, the answer to this can change.
    </p>
    <h2>Economic Implications</h2>
    <p> 
      One of the major issues that comes with illegal immigration is the costs that come with them being in the country. According to a <a href="https://www.irli.org/new-fair-study-illegal-immigration-costs-116-billion-annually/?gclid=CjwKCAjwu_mSBhAYEiwA5BBmf2zq0DL-ruGFGQZpOFPymhCAKj-EWurf8xxb3qWwkmLbvdQ-DPGDvBoCenUQAvD_BwE">FAIR study,</a> the costs of illegal immigration after including tax revenue comes out to $116 million. The biggest expense comes from medical with law enforcement coming in second. There is debate as to whter or not illegal immigrants should be able to receive benefits with one side saying it is the right thing to do as a prospering country, while the other side says that money should be put aside for actual citizens of the country.
      One thing that can be fixed immedialty with immigration reform would be to limit the amount that goes into law enforcement with this issue but this can be done in several different ways.  The economics of immigration reform is extremely nuanced and can be approached in many different ways and should have the focus of what benefits the most people in this country whether it's citizens or immigrants.
    </p>
    <h2>Political Implications</h2>
    <p>
      Both parties take a different stance as to how immigration reform should be approached. Republicans believe immigration should put more of an emphesis on having more legal immigrants and limiting the amount of illegal immigrants with stonger borders and deporting those who are here illegaly. They believe spending more on illegal immigration takes away from the money we could be spending on immigrants trying to become citizens through the legal process. This can have some downsides to it because it can be seen as inhumane to not allow those in need to stay in the country especially if they have been here for an extended period of time.
      Democrats tend to take the approach that we should be working to allow illegal immigrants to become citizens with an easier process and allowing those in most need illegal or not to become citizens. The problem with this stance can come with weaker borders which could increase crime and drug trafficing on the southern border. It could also encourage a large amount of immigrants to cross the border illegaly which would cause us to spend more money on illegal immigration every year.  There is complications to both approaches and the best way to go about implimenting change is to encorparate things from both sides to come to a good result.
    </p>
    <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
    <p>
      I believe there can be an approach to immigration reform that can benefit everyone in this country whether they are legal or not and coming to a decision both sides can agree is absolutley necessary. Unfortunatly, with how the political climate currently is, it can be hard to see this happening anytime soon.
      Hopefully, there can be significant progress that encompasses the needs of everyone and can lead to this country becoming a better place.
