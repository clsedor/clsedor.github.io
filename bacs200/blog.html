    <h2>About Immigration Reform</h2>
      <p>
        Immigration reform is not just something that has started as a conversation over the past few years, but has been a topic of debate for our society and political leaders since the start of this country. The <a href="https://cis.org/Historical-Overview-Immigration-Policy">history of immigration</a>can date back to 1876, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared immigration a federal responsibility.
        Today, there is a large debate in our country as to whether or not our immigration policy should be opened to more individuals or less, and also a debate as to what should be done with individuals who have entered the country illegaly in the past and are now seeking citizenship. This is a complicated issue as the decisions that are made can have a major impact on not just those seeking to immigrate to this country but also the country as a whole.  Both parties have taken a different approach to immigration reform and would like to discuss what both of those stances are and what implications could come from a social, economical and political stand point.

    <h2>Social Implications</h2>
      <p> 
        In a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12159550/">Pubmed.gov</a> It discusses the issues of immigrants and migrants who come here from other countries. One of the biggest social problems for immigrants usually comes with the stress of moving to a new country where they may or may not know English at a proficient level. This can cause issues with getting a job along with numerous other aspects to adapting to the culural changes.
        This problem has been shown to be fixed with more education for incoming immigrants to make sure they can become properley assimilated into America's lifestyle change.  One issue that arises with this is if the U.S. should provide this type of education for illegal immigrants and provide resources for them. One solution to this would be limiting the amount of illegal immigrants in this country by either enacting stronger borders or making it easier for those to become citizens so they can remove the status of illegal from them.
        Depending on which side of the politicla spectrum you stand on, the answer to this can change.
